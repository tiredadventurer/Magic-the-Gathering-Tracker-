# Magic-the-Gathering-Tracker-
Blurb Web Browser app for tracking health and counters in Magic the Gathering 

## Introduction 

This is a simple web brower app that helps keep track of counters on various card types, health and commander damage in Magic the Gathering 

## How to Use

To use this web app, all you need to do is to download the zip file and extract all. Then go into the folder and click tracker.html
The app will open in your preferred web browser. For optimal performance, I recommend you use Chrome or Firefox.

## Features

### Initial State 

Health - the app includes plus and minus buttons to control health points

Health Selector - you can change health points by selecting from a drop down menu

Commander Damage - there are also plus and minus buttons to keep track of commander damage 

Add Card - this button dynamically creates a new box with tools to track info regarding specific cards that may have tokens on them

New Game - this button resets everything to the original state with starting health 40 and no cards 

### Card Features

Write Card Name - this input allows you to add the name of your card you want to track. The heading changes in response to your input
Add Counter - this generates a feature that lets you track number of counters. It includes input to describe type of counter, plus and minus buttons and a delete button
if you no longer need to track this counter
Delete Card - this button deletes the card if you no longer need to track the card 
New Card - adds another card. Essentially it does the same thing that Add Card does. It allows you to add more cards without having to scroll up to the original box 

## Acknowledgement

First I wish to acknowledge that this project was inspired and based on the Score Keeper Exercise of Colt Steele's Web Development course on Udemy.
Secondly, I used the Bulma framework to style everything on my webpage. I did not write any CSS for this project. Bulma is similiar to Bootstrap and you
